# Travel

This is a simple project to practice using React and API requests. The app is intended to help travelers prepare for a trip. The user types in the name of a city and the app returns useful information about the destination. I wanted to include cost of living data, but I couldn't find a free alternative to Numbeo API, so I chose to display current weather information (https://developer.accuweather.com/), and a cheap flight ticket offer from my location, PRAGUE, CZR to the specified destination (https://developers.amadeus.com/, https://airlabs.co/). Details about how the information is retrieved or the amount of data available can be found on each website. 

I've decided to keep everything simple and limit the amount of information that is requested and displayed. The possibilities, however, are great. 
Version 2.0 may include a flights search widget with the option to change origin location and choose dates, several flight offers on display, weather forecast for several days, in addition to the current conditions, and better styling.
