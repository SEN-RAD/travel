This is a simple project to practice using React and API requests. The app helps people prepare for a trip. The concept is simple: the user types in the name of a city and the app returns useful information about the destination. Initially, I wanted to include relevant cost of living information, to assist travellers in preparing a budget for their trips, but there is no free alternative to the Numbeo API, so I had to work with the free alternatives at my disposal. In this case, just to illustrate the concept, I have chosen to display current weather information (https://developer.accuweather.com/), and a cheap flight ticket offer from my location, PRAGUE, CZR to the specified destination (https://developers.amadeus.com/, https://airlabs.co/). Details about how the information is retrieved or the amount of data available can be found on each website. 

For my purposes, I decided to keep everything simple and limit the amount of information that is requested and displayed. The possibilities, however, are great. Version 2.0 may include a flights search widget with the option to change origin location and choose dates, several flight offers on display, weather forecast for several days  in addition to the current conditions, and better styling.
