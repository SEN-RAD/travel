# Travel

This is a simple project using React and API requests. **Travel** helps travelers prepare for a trip. The user types in the name of a city and receives useful information about the destination + a cheap flight ticket offer.

**Travel** is simple and limited in the amount of information that requests and displays. However, these basic funcionalities may be used at a professional level and the possibilities are great. 

**Travel** displays current weather information (https://developer.accuweather.com/) and a cheap flight ticket offer to the specified destination (https://developers.amadeus.com/, https://airlabs.co/). Details about how the information is retrieved or the amount of data available can be found on each API website. The app uses the current date and PRAGUE, CZR, as parameters for the flight ticket search. An updated version could include an actual flights search widget with the option to change origin location and choose dates

Ideally, **Travel** will also include cost of living data (e.g. Numbeo API) as soon as I'm able to find a free resource.

Version 1.2 may include rewriting of some passages for better readability and improved efficiency (e.g.then() to Async/Await), weather forecast for several days, in addition to the current conditions, and better styling.
